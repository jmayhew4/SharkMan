# SharkMan

### About

Sharkman is a goofy and intentionally easy platformer built in Unity for fun. Don't take it very seriously. 

I use it mostly for testing purposes of random things in Unity.


### Credits

The title music is original, but the in-game music is my own 8-bit remake of the song 'Fallen Down' from Undertale.

The sprite work is my own, with the exception of the dog being a ripoff from Undertale.
